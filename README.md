3. Place the token in a file called `token.json` in the same directory as `sans.py`, then run `sans.py`.

6. In sans.js, replace the part where it says `yourtoken` with the token of your bot.
7. Open terminal and run `cd (wherever you're keeping sans.js)` and then `node sans.js`.
Enjoy hosting Sans!

If you tried hosting the bot what the fuck is wrong with you? This barely works anywhere else but my computer what makes you think that its a good idea.
